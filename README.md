# 簡易架構說明

在主畫面元件的外層包裝錯誤邊界(src/component/ErrorBoundary)
主畫面顯示分為三部分
1.畫面標題
2.查詢輸入欄
3.查詢資料顯示

輸入查詢後改變查詢字串狀態(queryString)並重製查詢狀況狀態(page, end, dataList, isLoading, isError)
在fetchData加入debounce機制變為delayFetch，大量減少查詢條件尚未輸入完的無效查詢。
透過useEffect觸發delayFetch查詢新資料

設計useScroll hook，透過ref對元素加入scroll event的監聽。
抓取元素offsetHeight與scrollHeight得出可捲動的高度來和已捲動高度做比較判斷是否捲到最底。
如果捲到最底則page + 1來觸發useEffect執行delayFetch。
假如dataList的length等於回傳的total_count，則end設為true，阻止page再加1。
假如isLoading為true，則新資料還在查詢中，同樣會阻止page再加1。

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
